# Deep Learning Project: Visualizing Representations and Analyzing Loss Curves

## Project Overview
This project delves into the intricacies of deep learning models, particularly focusing on visualizing representations, analyzing loss curves, and understanding the structure and behavior of models. Through various visualizations and experiments, the project explores the impact of different factors like the KL loss term, $\beta$ values, and t-SNE reliability on model performance and representation.

## Key Discussions

### Visualization of Representations
- Observations on the structure of visualized representations are discussed.
- The role of the KL loss term and $\beta$ in shaping these representations.
- Analysis includes considering outliers, boundaries, and clusters.
- Reliability of t-SNE visualizations and the effect of varying its parameters.

### Analysis of Loss Curves and Reconstructions
- Examination of the behavior of log-likelihood loss and KL loss.
- Discussion on whether the observed behavior is desirable or indicative of issues like posterior collapse.
- Strategies for mitigating posterior collapse and its impact on output samples.

## Engineering Choices
- Details on the process leading to the final architecture.
- Empirically useful methods, effective strategies, and impactful modifications.
- Insights into what didn't work, what did, and what mattered most in model development.

## Additional Notes
- For a comprehensive understanding, the project includes multiple plots and visualizations, accessible via public links embedded in the notebook.
- When referencing local files, relative pathing is used, ensuring ease of access and clarity.

## How to Use
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to visualize model representations, analyze loss curves, and understand the engineering choices made.
- Modify parameters and observe changes to deepen your understanding of model dynamics.
